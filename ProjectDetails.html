  <h1>An Indoor AI-Based Navigator for Hassle-Free Navigation of the Visually Impaired</h1>
  <p>An indoor AI-based navigator for hassle-free navigation of the visually impaired. The problem can be broadly
    classified mainly into two tasks: object detection and measuring the distance of objects. So, according to the
    requirement, we have developed two separate modules for the above-mentioned which make the system an all-inclusive,
    portable, and user-friendly system. The development cost of the system is also far less than the modules currently
    available in the market. Voice-based aid would be provided to the visually impaired through speakers and sensors.
    The ultrasonic sensor helps in recognizing objects within the vicinity that might not be captured by the cameras and
    produce an alerting sound for the user to avoid any sudden bump.</p>

  <p>Certain hardware units using Jetson Nano and Arduino along with ultrasonic sensors are used for navigation and
    locating certain objects, thus helping them manage their daily schedules and improve their activities. The proposed
    system works offline and can be extended to work outside home premises by making minor changes in hardware and
    software.</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>The target audience of the project, visually impaired, by this system, will aid the visually impaired to walk freely
    in the nearby surroundings by giving them information about various objects, placement of the objects, alerting them
    in case of sudden bumping, all of which will be informed to the end user via headphones.</p>

  <h2>System Overview</h2>
  <p>Significant improvements in the detection and frame rate are achieved with the use of GPU. The system not only assists
    the visually challenged in making them aware of the objects in their vicinity but also can now aid in finding and
    guiding towards any object of interest the user desires. After the specified object is detected, the system helps in
    orienting the user towards the object and aligns him/her in front of the aforementioned object.</p>

  <p>The system makes efficient use of the available GPU processing power and memory. Some of the constraints in the proposed
    system are overcome with the use of parallel processing and a lightweight object detection module without compromising
    the frame rate or accuracy. There can be a further increase in the accuracy and FPS rate if a machine with large processing
    power or more cores is to be used instead of the existing GPU.</p>

  <p>In consideration of the overall cost of such a system and the processing power of Jetson Nano, the proposed system is able
    to achieve the goals satisfactorily.</p>
